# Contributing to AATMF

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Adversarial AI Threat Modeling Framework!

## 🎯 Types of Contributions We Welcome

- **New Techniques**: Documented adversarial AI techniques not yet in AATMF
- **Real-World Case Studies**: Evidence of AATMF techniques in production incidents
- **Defense Mappings**: Links between AATMF techniques and mitigation strategies
- **Framework Crosswalks**: Mappings to MITRE ATLAS, OWASP, NIST AI RMF
- **Documentation Improvements**: Typo fixes, clarity enhancements, examples

## 📋 Contribution Process

### For New Techniques

1. **Check for Duplicates**: Search existing issues and the framework taxonomy
2. **Open an Issue First**: Describe the technique using our template
3. **Wait for Approval**: Maintainers will confirm it's in scope
4. **Submit PR**: Reference the issue number in your PR

### For Documentation/Typos

1. **Fork the repo**
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b fix-typo-tactic-4`
3. **Make changes**
4. **Submit PR**: No issue needed for small fixes

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

- All techniques must follow the AATMF ID format: `AATMF-XXX`
- Include at minimum: Rationale, Scenario, Example, Detectability (Low/Med/High)
- Real-world examples preferred over theoretical
- If proposing MITRE ATLAS mappings, cite specific technique IDs

## 📝 Pull Request Template

**When submitting a PR, include:**

- **Summary**: One-sentence description
- **Technique Details** (if applicable):
  - AATMF ID: AATMF-XXX
  - Tactic: [e.g., Prompt Injection, Memory Manipulation]
  - Risk Level: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Testing**: Did you verify the example works against a real LLM?
- **References**: Links to research, CVEs, or incident reports

## ✅ Code Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: Markdown linting, link validation
2. **Maintainer Review**: 1-2 business days (we're human!)
3. **Feedback**: We may request changes or clarifications
4. **Merge**: Once approved, your contribution is live!
